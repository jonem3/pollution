Multiple inputs possible to NEAT algorithm e.g. all of the weather station data

Also all the inputs from the historical pollution data

However, other factors that may affect pollution:
* Time of day
* Day of week
* If a bank holiday

All of these can be calculated for the data

Time of day can only be used if the pollution data is that granular
